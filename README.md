## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For around 20 years, I have been working a lot on many projects, since small websites, simple e-commerce projects, SaaS, mobile apps, and entire full-stack applications. I migrated from PHP to Node in the last 6 years, so, I have been a lot busy putting focus on Javascript Stack creating scalable software with Node, React and now, Vue.js. As I like to push myself towards the next level, I have been diving into SOLID philosophy, clean code, and tests in order to deliver high quality software.

I have a lot of motivations, but the biggest maybe is to contribute on impactful projects, to contribute for making people's life better with my work.

Love animals, and I hate to kill even a tiny ant. Also, I enjoy to try to learn shuffle, I think this dance style is awesome lol.

## ðŸŒ± What I have been learning recently

### Diving into AWS Services
Besides I already used a few AWS services in my personal and projects in at the work, I like to dive into in the technology and to amplify my knowledge about everything around my tech stack. Everything that can help me thrive more and more in technology and of course, help companies and coallegues to build amazing and scalable software.
